**Kirri:** (holding up his phone)
"This phone contains the Apple A17 Pro chip with over 19 billion transistors—tiny switches that must each fire at exactly the right moment to make the chip work.

And here's the reality: for complex FPGA and ASIC designs, hardware engineers spend 50-80% of their project time on timing closure. That's the majority of every project cycle, just untangling timing violations instead of building innovative features. It's the most time-intensive part of chip development."

**Raiya:**
“And it’s only getting worse. As chips get more advanced, they’re becoming mind-bogglingly complex.

A modern FPGA like the Xilinx UltraScale+ can have millions of timing paths that must be analyzed. If even one critical path violates timing by nanoseconds or even picoseconds, the entire design can fail in the field.

This process of chasing down and fixing those timing issues is called timing closure—and it's consistently ranked as the top design bottleneck in industry surveys.

It's why FPGA projects commonly face 3-6 month delays, and why the EDA timing analysis tools market represents over $2 billion in annual spending. Every day spent on timing closure delays time-to-market for critical products."

**Kirri:** (showing a timing report)
“Here’s what engineers stare at every day.

This is a real Static Timing Analysis report from a production design. It’s pages of cryptic numbers and warnings:

* Setup violations. Hold violations. Negative slack. Clock domain mismatches.

It's like trying to find a single problematic connection among millions of interconnected logic paths—each with its own timing requirements.

And even if you find one issue and fix it, you might accidentally break five others. It’s a never-ending cycle.”

**Raiya:**
"Imagine getting a timing report with thousands of violations—but not knowing which ones are critical and which ones you can safely ignore. That's the daily reality for hardware engineers."

### THE AI BREAKTHROUGH

**Kirri:**
“That’s why we built Clkwise. An AI copilot for timing closure.

Watch this: I’ll take this exact same messy timing report, plus the design files and logs… and upload them into Clkwise.”

**Raiya:**
"Processing… and done. In under a second.

Instead of pages of incomprehensible errors, Clkwise gives us:

* Plain English explanations of the top critical issues
* Step-by-step fixes engineers can apply
* Predicted results showing how much faster or more power-efficient the design will become.”

**Kirri:**
"In seconds, what used to take hours or days of manual analysis is solved. And the key is—engineers stay in control. Clkwise doesn't just provide answers; it helps experts understand their designs faster and make more informed decisions."

**Raiya:**
“It’s like going from reading ancient hieroglyphics to having real-time subtitles in your own language. This is how AI makes experts more productive.”

**Kirri:**
"Clkwise uses a dual AI pipeline:
* One part is built for lightning-fast analysis of massive timing datasets
* The other is built for deep reasoning and synthesis, learning how design choices ripple across an entire chip.

It doesn’t just see patterns—it understands causes and effects.”

**Kirri:**
“That’s what makes it powerful. Clkwise can tell you:
‘This multiply unit is failing timing by 2.3 nanoseconds. Add a pipeline stage here, shift the clock phase by 150 picoseconds, and use higher threshold voltage cells on these side paths to save power.’

Real fixes, real context, real impact.”


**Raiya:**
What if timing closure wasn’t a bottleneck anymore? What if hardware engineers could spend their time on innovation, not debugging—on designing better chips, faster chips, greener chips?”

**Kirri:**
“Every smartphone, every autonomous car, every AI accelerator—all of them depend on precise timing. We’re not just building a tool. We’re building a future where hardware innovation can move at the speed of software.”

**Raiya:**
“Clkwise is ready. We have a market. We have a build. And we’ve already shown real results.”

**Kirri:**
“The next generation of devices is waiting. Let’s make timing closure intelligent. Thank you.”

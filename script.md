**Kirri:** (holding up his phone)
“This phone has over 20 billion transistors—tiny switches that must each fire at exactly the right moment to make the chip work.

And here’s the shocking truth: hardware engineers spend 60% of their time not designing new chips, but fixing timing errors. That’s 24 hours every single week, just untangling mysterious timing violations instead of building the future. It’s frustrating, it’s exhausting—and it’s slowing down everything.”

**Raiya:**
“And it’s only getting worse. As chips get more advanced, they’re becoming mind-bogglingly complex.

A single modern processor might contain hundreds of millions of connections and timing paths. If even one path is a few trillionths of a second too slow, the entire chip can fail.

This process of chasing down and fixing those timing issues is called timing closure—and it’s now the #1 bottleneck stopping new products from reaching the market.

It’s why every major chip launch is delayed by months. And across the entire semiconductor industry, this problem costs over \$100 billion a year in wasted time, lost revenue, and missed market windows.”

**Kirri:** (showing a timing report)
“Here’s what engineers stare at every day.

This is a real Static Timing Analysis report from a production design. It’s pages of cryptic numbers and warnings:

* Setup violations. Hold violations. Negative slack. Clock domain mismatches.

It’s like trying to find a single frayed wire in a maze of 50 million invisible wires—blindfolded.

And even if you find one issue and fix it, you might accidentally break five others. It’s a never-ending cycle.”

**Raiya:**
“Imagine being told you have 50,000 things wrong with your design—but no one tells you which 3 actually matter. That’s the nightmare engineers are living in.”

### THE AI BREAKTHROUGH

**Kirri:**
“That’s why we built Clkwise. An AI copilot for timing closure.

Watch this: I’ll take this exact same messy timing report, plus the design files and logs… and upload them into Clkwise.”

**Raiya:**
“Processing… and done. In milliseconds.

Instead of pages of incomprehensible errors, Clkwise gives us:

* Plain English explanations of the top critical issues
* Step-by-step fixes engineers can apply
* Predicted results showing how much faster or more power-efficient the design will become.”

**Kirri:**
“In seconds, what used to take days or weeks is solved. And the magic is—engineers stay in control. Clkwise doesn’t just spit out answers; it helps experts understand their designs faster and make smarter decisions.”

**Raiya:**
“It’s like going from reading ancient hieroglyphics to having real-time subtitles in your own language. This is how AI makes experts more productive.”

**Kirri:**
"Clkwise uses a dual AI pipeline:
* One part is built for lightning-fast analysis of massive timing datasets
* The other is built for deep reasoning and synthesis, learning how design choices ripple across an entire chip.

It doesn’t just see patterns—it understands causes and effects.”

**Kirri:**
“That’s what makes it powerful. Clkwise can tell you:
‘This multiply unit is failing timing by 2.3 nanoseconds. Add a pipeline stage here, shift the clock phase by 150 picoseconds, and use higher threshold voltage cells on these side paths to save power.’

Real fixes, real context, real impact.”


**Raiya:**
What if timing closure wasn’t a bottleneck anymore? What if hardware engineers could spend their time on innovation, not debugging—on designing better chips, faster chips, greener chips?”

**Kirri:**
“Every smartphone, every autonomous car, every AI accelerator—all of them depend on precise timing. We’re not just building a tool. We’re building a future where hardware innovation can move at the speed of software.”

**Raiya:**
“Clkwise is ready. We have a market. We have a build. And we’ve already shown real results.”

**Kirri:**
“The next generation of devices is waiting. Let’s make timing closure intelligent. Thank you.”

# Clkwise: AI-Powered FPGA Timing Debugger

*Revolutionizing chip design with intelligent timing closure*

---

## The Problem

**FPGA timing closure is the #1 bottleneck in hardware development**

- Engineers spend **40-60% of their time** debugging timing violations
- Complex timing reports are **cryptic and overwhelming** (thousands of paths)
- Traditional fixes are **trial-and-error** based on experience
- Design iterations can take **hours to days** to verify
- **Critical time-to-market delays** due to timing closure struggles

## Our Solution: Clkwise

**The world's first AI-powered FPGA timing debugger** that transforms complex timing reports into actionable insights in seconds.

### Core Innovation: Dual AI Pipeline

```
Raw Timing Data → Cerebras Analysis → Cohere Synthesis → Actionable Fixes
    (Milliseconds)        (<100ms)             (Smart reasoning)      (Human-readable)
```

**What makes us unique:**
- **Dual AI reasoning**: Cerebras for speed + Cohere for depth
- **Expert heuristics validation**: AI suggestions validated by timing closure experts
- **Real-time feedback**: Sub-second analysis of complex timing reports
- **Natural language output**: Convert cryptic violations into clear action items

## Technical Architecture

### AI-First Design
- **Primary Engine**: Cerebras (LLaMA 3.1-70B) for ultra-fast initial analysis
- **Reasoning Engine**: Cohere (Command R+) for deep synthesis and validation
- **Fallback System**: Expert heuristics ensure reliability even without AI
- **Confidence Scoring**: Every suggestion comes with reliability metrics

### Production-Ready Pipeline
```
Input Layer     → Parsing & Validation → AI Analysis → Guardrails → Output

```

### Multi-Interface Access
- **Web Dashboard**: Upload reports, view analysis, interactive chat
- **CLI Tool**: Terminal integration for developer workflows  
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful integration with existing toolchains
- **CLI Tool**: Terminal integration for developer workflows

## Live Demo Experience

### Input: Vivado Timing Report
```
Path: u_dsp/mult_reg[31]/Q → u_core/add_reg[31]/D
Slack: -2.5ns (VIOLATED)
Logic Levels: 12
Routing Delay: 65%
```

### Processing: Dual AI Analysis
1. **Cerebras** (85ms): Identifies deep logic + routing issues
2. **Cohere** (200ms): Synthesizes comprehensive fix strategy
3. **Validation** (15ms): Expert heuristics verify suggestions

### Output: Actionable Insights
```
Analysis of Critical Path P0001

Issue Classification: Setup Violation
Root Causes:
   • Deep combinational logic (12 levels) 
   • Excessive routing congestion (65%)

Recommended Fixes:
1. Pipeline Optimization
   → Insert 3 pipeline stages in u_dsp module
   → Expected improvement: +3.2ns

2. Placement Strategy  
   → Add pblock to co-locate u_dsp and u_core
   → Expected improvement: +1.8ns

Implementation Considerations:
   • Pipeline adds 3-cycle latency - update protocol timing
   • Verify downstream timing assumptions

Confidence: 89% | Processing: 145ms | Expected WNS: +0.7ns
```

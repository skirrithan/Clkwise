Perfect — let’s map **how you can intentionally hit each sponsor requirement** in your chip-design timing-debugger project, including  now too.

Here’s a **clear sponsor checklist**:

---

## 🏗 Sponsor Requirements + How to Hit Them

---

### 📡  — Core Network Dataset Focus

**Goal:** Use network datasets or networking concepts.
**Plan:**

* Treat chip modules and connections as a “network” graph.
* Collect timing congestion data between modules and build a network traffic-style dataset.
* Analyze “network flow bottlenecks” across the chip’s timing paths.
  ✅ Shows network data analysis focus.

---

### 💻  — Developer Terminal Tool

**Goal:** Build something that lives in or enhances Warp.
**Plan:**

* Create a CLI for the AI debugger inside Warp.
* Show real-time inline annotated timing violations as you type.
* Use Warp multiplayer sessions for collaborative chip debugging.
  ✅ Shows Warp-native workflow + developer productivity.

---

### ✨  — Fallback/Natural Language Summarization

**Goal:** Use Gemini’s strength in NLU and summarization.
**Plan:**

* Use Gemini to summarize long static timing analysis (STA) reports.
* Convert cryptic error logs into plain language action items.
  ✅ Makes complex design feedback accessible and human-readable.

---

### ⚡  — Real-Time Engine

**Goal:** Use Groq’s real-time LLM inference.
**Plan:**

* Deploy your custom Verilog-timing LLM on Groq hardware.
* Get millisecond-latency feedback on timing fixes as engineers iterate.
  ✅ Enables ultra-fast loop for design-debug-fix cycles.

---

### 🧪  — Best Use of Databricks

**Goal:** Use Databricks for large data + ML.
**Plan:**

* Store and preprocess RTL/timing datasets at scale.
* Train/fine-tune timing-debug LLMs collaboratively on Databricks notebooks.
  ✅ Positions your solution as data-intensive and ML-heavy.

---

### ☁️  — Best Use of&#x20;

**Goal:** Use DynamoDB Streams in a meaningful way.
**Plan:**

* Store submitted designs and timing logs in DynamoDB.
* Trigger analysis pipelines using DynamoDB Streams on each upload.
  ✅ Demonstrates real-time event-driven backend.

---

### 🧠  — Engineering Dream Team

**Goal:** Showcase collaboration and code review.
**Plan:**

* Generate AI timing-fix patches as Graphite pull requests.
* Track contributions, reviews, and approvals visually.
  ✅ Emphasizes collaborative engineering workflow.

---

### 🤖  — Best AI Agent

**Goal:** Build an autonomous multi-step AI agent.
**Plan:**

* Rox agent orchestrates:

  * Detect timing issue → Ask LLM → Generate fix → Commit → Verify.
    ✅ Shows full AI agent pipeline.

---

### 💬  — LLMs for Developer Tools or Agents

**Goal:** Use Cohere’s models for language understanding or retrieval.
**Plan:**

* Use  to create vector search on Verilog/timing snippets.
* Use  as a fast lightweight fallback model to retrieve known timing fixes.
  ✅ Highlights retrieval-augmented dev tool use of Cohere.
